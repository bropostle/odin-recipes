    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>10 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>1 cup (100 grams) granulated sugar, divided</li>
        <li>3 cups (720 milliliters) heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 cups (480 milliliters) whole milk</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon fine salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk the egg yolks and 1/2 cup (100 grams)
            of the sugar until well combined.</li>
        <li>In a large saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the cream, milk,
            the remaining 1/2 cup (100 grams) of the sugar, vanilla and salt and,
            stirring frequently to prevent scorching on the bottom, bring the mixture
            to a simmer, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.</li>
        <li>With a ladle in one hand and a whisk in the other, drizzle a small amount
            of the heated liquid into the egg mixture while whisking. Continue until 
            about a third of the hot liquid has been blended with the eggs and the mixture 
            feels warm to the touch. Slowly pour the egg mixture back into the pot, continuing 
            to whisk until the custard is smooth and well combined.</li>
        <li>Return the saucepan to medium heat and let the custard come to a simmter, 
            with small bubble around the edges; it should be thick enough to coat the back
             of a wooden spoon, or register about 170 degrees on an instant-read thermometer.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat.</li>
        <li>Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a large containter with a 
            tightfitting lid, stirring and pressing the custard through with a silicone 
            spatula or wooden spoon. Cover and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 
            6 hours and preferably overnight.</li>
        <li>Assemble your ice cream machine. Pour in the chilled custard and churn according to
             the manufacturer's instructions. The custard should be the consistency of soft-serve 
             ice cream. Place the now-empty storage container in the freezer to chill while 
             ice cream freezes.</li>
        <li>Pack the ice cream into the chilled storage container. Press a piece of wax paper 
            directly against the surface and cover with the lid. Freeze in the coldest part of your 
            freezer until firm, at least 6 hours and preferably overnight.</li>
    </ol>
